# Odin Shopping Cart

A mock shopping cart built as part of studying [**The Odin Project's React course**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react). The main goal of this project is to implement the concepts learned so far: testing, routing, styling, fetching data, and using prop types.
